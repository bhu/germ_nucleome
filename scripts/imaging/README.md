* Each DAPI-stained nucleus was captured by Zeiss LSM980 (i.e., one nucleus in one image)
* Following Airyscan processing, the DAPI-stained nuclei images were processed by `*.ijm` using ImageJ
* After unzipping `*_nuclear_periphery_roiset.zip`, these files were further analyzed by `image_summary.R` to produce the `*.rda` files containing the summary of imaging analyses
